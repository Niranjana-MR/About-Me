- 👋 Hi, I’m @Niranjana-MR
- 👀 Interested in Web Technologies and security. Security always facinates. Currently, I'm still learning to build things before, eventually, I break it.
- 🌱 Right now, I'm learning JavaScript.
- 💞️ Open to collaborate on simple web projects that will also help me in learning something new.  
- 📫 You can reach me on GitHub or even leave a message on my LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/niranjana-m-r-a48274168/
